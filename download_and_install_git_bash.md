# Download and Install git Bash Client on MacOS

While installing the git bash client on Windows OS is simple, performing the same on a Mac OS requires an additional step to allow the package file to be installed.

Here is the procedure:

1. Download the git bash client package for MacOS from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
    The downloaded file will have a `.dmg` extension.
2. Double click the `.dmg`file, and you will get the `PKG`file, a README.txt file, and a version file.

3. Double click the `PKG` file, the following error message is displays:
> `"macOS cannot verify the developer of “git-2.15.0-intel-universal-mavericks.pkg”. Are you sure you want to open it?" Click Open and this should then work.
"git-2.23.0-intel-universal-mavericks.pkg" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.`
>

    Click OK to dismiss this message.

4. Right click the `PKG` file, and select Òpen With -> Installer (default)' option. 

The error message appear again but now an addtional button `Open` is displayed.

5. Click 'Open` to open the Installation wizarad. 

6. Complete the onscreen instructions in the Installation wizard to complete the git bash client installation.
