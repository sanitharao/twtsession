# Understading Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that accepts content written in markup language, and uses predefined layout/style to display the contents of the markdown file in an HTML format. You can override the formatting provided by Jekyll by defining a `.css` file.

For more information on Jekyll, see the [Jekyll Documenation page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
