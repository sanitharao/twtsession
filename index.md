# What is all the buzz about Markdown?

Before I attended the course [Docs-as-code Certificate Course: Markdown, Git, Jekyll, and You](https://techwriterstribe.com/course/docs-as-code-jekyll/) conducted by [TechWriters Tribe](https://techwriterstribe.com/), the term `Markdown` sounded complex, and gave me a feeling that it must be an invention of the 20th century. Well, Google says that Markdown was created in 2004 and I was correct to that extent.   



# What are Markdown, Jekyll, and GitHub?

The document also discusses the content management system, GitHub, that you can use to store Markdown files.
