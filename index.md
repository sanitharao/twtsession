This document briefly explains about the Markdown language, the editors that you can use to create/edit a Markdown file. The document also discusses the content management system, GitHub, that you can use to store Markdown files. Further to discussing Markdown, this document also discusses about the static site generator, Jekyll that GitHub uses to post Markdown files in HTML format.
